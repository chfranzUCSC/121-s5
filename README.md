# Section 5 – Refactoring Code Smells in Practice

# <<<<<<< HEADChris Franz

This activity is designed to help you practice identifying code smells and applying refactoring patterns to a real codebase in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns.

## Assignment Instructions

For this assignment, your task is to **analyze and improve the code in `src/main.ts`**:

1. **Identify code smells**: Review the code and look for patterns that may cause maintenance issues, reduce readability, or introduce potential bugs.
2. **Refactor**: Apply **refactoring patterns** as described in Fowler’s _Refactoring_ book to improve the code.
3. **Document your work**: Once you have completed your refactoring:
   - Rewrite this README.md
   - List the **code smells** you identified
   - Describe the **refactoring patterns** you applied and how they improved the code
